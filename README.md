# Wapaper App

This is a simple and elegant Wallpaper App built with Flutter that allows users to browse, search, and set high-quality wallpapers directly from their mobile devices. The app integrates with the Unsplash API to provide an extensive collection of free, high-resolution images. Users can explore a variety of categories, view details of each wallpaper, and easily set them as their device's background.
